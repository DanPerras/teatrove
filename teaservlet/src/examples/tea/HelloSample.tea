    It should be noted that this template is overkill
    and the HelloSampleApp in general is unnecessary
    except for demonstration purposes.  The ability
    to retrieve query string parameters is already
    included in the teaservlet.  For example:
    
    <% template SimpleHelloSample(String name)%>
    Hello <%name%>
    
    would do the same thing without even having to
    write a tea application.
